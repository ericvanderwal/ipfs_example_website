                        <strong> Description:</strong>

                        The Playmaker Slack channel has been an invaluable resource on my game development path. It has been both a solid community for sharing and bouncing ideas off of, as well as a repository of knowledge that is easy to tap into.

                        The sense of community is immediate – as long as I’ve been a member, each and every new person who joins is greeted with a handwritten welcome (no bots here!) and members quickly take that warmness and carry on the tradition and welcome newer folks in a similar manner.

                        The community is also amazingly helpful; whether its puzzling out how to solve a problem (people will  look through an issue step by step to help out!) or give feedback on each others work – its one of the best places I’ve been for game dev assistance.

                        <strong> Description:</strong> VRTK (Virtual Reality Toolkit) was the premier VR system for the
                        Unity Game Engine. During my time with Playmaker, I developed numerous integrations between
                        third-party packages and Playmaker using C# that were released open-source. While the code
                        quality was not high (I was new at the time), it functions well and has been used in places
                        ranging from the Smithsonian to early Square Enix prototypes.</p>

                        <strong> Description:</strong> Backdrop Live is an online event for Backdrop CMS, an open-source
                        content management system. I gave a talk in March 2021 to Backdrop users and core
                        developers on general Web Accessibility. Following the video there was a one hour Q&A session.
                        Additionally, I consult on implementing Web Accessibility into Backdrop core themes and
                        functions.</p>
