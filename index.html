                        <br>
                        <strong>Venue:</strong> Slack<br>
                        <strong> Description:</strong>

                        Creating, managing, and interacting with the Playmaker social community on Slack has been an
                        absolute privilege and at the top of my list for successes in developer relations. The regular
                        (and less regular) community members have developed unique projects from their hard work and
                        imagination; From Square Enix to teens developing indie games for school. It is an open and
                        inclusive environment that welcomes new members enthusiastically.

                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Community Feedback:</strong></p>

                        <p>
                            The Playmaker Slack channel has been an invaluable resource on my game development path. It
                            has
                            been both a solid community for sharing and bouncing ideas off of, as well as a repository
                            of
                            knowledge that is easy to tap into.
                        </p>

                        <p> The sense of community is immediate – as long as I’ve been a member, each and every new
                            person
                            who joins is greeted with a handwritten welcome (no bots here!) and members quickly take
                            that
                            warmness and carry on the tradition and welcome newer folks in a similar manner.
                        </p>

                        <p> The community is also amazingly helpful; whether its puzzling out how to solve a problem
                            (people
                            will look through an issue step by step to help out!) or give feedback on each others work –
                            its
                            one of the best places I’ve been for game dev assistance.
                        </p>

                            The Playmaker Slack community was definitely one of my inspirations for becoming a Unity
                            Certified Instructor and developer. The fact that we were tackling hard problems together,
                            and
                            being able to discuss the ins and outs of Playmaker with Eric really made this community
                            valuable.
                        </p>

                        <p> Eric was the main facilitator of the community needs and Playmaker, hearing our issues and
                            needs
                            for additional scripts, actions, and guidance. I could always count on Playmaker, the
                            Ecosystem
                            tool, or community members to share their code snippets and solutions for my project. I
                            never
                            felt frustrated and overwhelmed.
                        </p>

                        <p> One of the best things is the yearly game jam led by Eric. The event encourages me to have a
                            weekend stretch goal to finish developing a (small) game that will be played by the
                            community.
                            This is usually the pinnacle of the community events and we have a great time learning to
                            know
                            each other and work together.

                        <strong>Venue: </strong>Itch.io (Online)<br>
                        <strong> Description:</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        I created the Playmaker Game Jam (hack-a-thon), an annual itch.io game jam, open to all
                        Playmaker users. It was first started to help foster community between Playmaker customers ( a
                        visual
                        scripting solution for the Unity Game Engine) and has been held annually since 2018.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Game Jam became a rallying point for many developers as a place to expand their creative
                        horizons outside of a commercial environment and to interact with their peers. It is an event
                        that I still look forward to each year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The three-day event was customarily held online in the summer or fall, with teams battling to
                        create the most entertaining games from scratch. As the sole organizer, I was responsible for
                        all planning and operations. Tasks included scheduling, sponsorships deals (prizes), rules and
                        regulations, judging criteria, and community management.

                        third-party packages and Playmaker using C# that were released open-source. While the code
                        quality is rought around the edges (I was new at the time), it functions well and has been used
                        in places
                        ranging from the Smithsonian to early AAA game prototypes.</p>

                        <strong>Venue: </strong>Vancouver, Canada<br>
                        <strong> Description:</strong></p>

                    <p> The Integrative Fertility Symposium (IFS) was a natural evolution from my work with Healthy
                        Seminars, where I planned content, coached speakers, and organized technical aspects for over
                        150 live webinars and in-person events.
                    </p>

                    <p> For the IFS, I was the co-organizer for five three and half-day symposiums from 2015 to 2019.
                        The symposium hosted over 250 physical attendees, typically 20 - 35 international speakers, in
                        three simultaneous talks while broadcasting live to around an additional 200 - 300 customers.
                    </p>

                    <p>Planning started six months before the event each year, and my role included everything from the
                        top-level planning to making sure attendees had their guest passes. Some notable contributions
                        were speaker selection, schedule planning, developing the event website (booking, payment,
                        permissioned content access), overseeing all technical aspects of the recording and live
                        streaming, reviewing talks, and more.
                    </p>
